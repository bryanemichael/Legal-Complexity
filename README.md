 # A Measure of the Complexity of Countries' Financial Law 

## What are these data?
These data show the similarity of provisions in various countries' banking and other financial law. 

## How did we make these data?
We started with Thorsten Beck, Asli Demirguc-Kunt, Ross Levine, Martin Cihak and Erik Feyen's Financial Development and Structure Dataset (updated Nov. 2013). For items which did not have numerical responses, we recategorised them (for example with yes=1 and no=0). We then performed multidimensional scaling on the 
dataset. The procedure classifies countries by the similarity in patterns of numbers across the over 800 provisions in their banking and other financial law (many of the questions in fact touch on areas outside of banking). 

## What exactly do these data tell us?
They only illustrate the extent to which different countries have more or less similar provisions in their banking and other financial law as of the time of the original Beck et al. database. 

## Why don't we report more information (like variances in these numbers, etc.)?
We don't want to give this exercise a gloss of scientific finality that other indices like the World Bank's Governance
Indicators have. We want to provide the user with a set of numbers measuring the "level" of financial law in circumstances where other measures do not exist. We aspire to nothing more and nothing less.
